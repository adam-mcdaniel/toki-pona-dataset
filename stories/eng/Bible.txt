The first book of Moses.

In the beginning, God created the blue sky and the big land. But the land was empty and everything was dark.
The spirit of God moved upon the water.
God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
God saw the light, and it was good. He separated the light from the darkness.
God called the light "Day," and the darkness he called "Night." This was the first day.

God said, "I am creating a large blue circle of water. It will not mix with the other waters."
God created the circle of blue water. It was good.
God called the circle of blue water "Sky." This was the second day.

God said, "Let all the water come together in one place, and let the dry ground appear." It happened as he said.
God called the dry ground "Land," and the water he called "Sea." God saw that it was good.
God said, "Let the land produce many plants." It happened as he said.
This was the third day.

God said, "Let there be many stars in the sky. Let them separate the day from the night. Let them be signs to show the seasons, days, and years.
Let them be lights in the sky to shine down on the earth." It happened as he said.
God saw that it was good.
This was the fourth day.

God said, "Let the water be filled with many living things, and let the air be filled with birds."
God created many large fish, small fish, and birds. God saw that it was good.
This was the fifth day.

God said, "Let there be many animals on the land." It happened as he said.
God created many animals. God saw that it was good.

God said, "I will create human beings. They will be like me and rule over the fish, birds, and animals, and everything on the earth."
God created male and female human beings. God blessed them and said to them, "Have many children and fill the earth. Rule over the fish, birds, and animals."
This was the sixth day
