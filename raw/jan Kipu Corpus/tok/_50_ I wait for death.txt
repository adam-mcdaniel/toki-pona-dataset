mi awen e moli
jan seme li pana e pona tawa mi ? 
jan ala li pana e pona tawa mi. 
jan seme li toki e lon tawa mi ? 
jan ala li toki e lon tawa mi. 
ken la, ijo li pakala lon lawa mi. 
mi pilin e ni: mi awen e moli. 
olin li lon seme ? 
olin li lon ala insa mi
seme li lon ? 
pimeja taso li lon. 
ken la, jan sewi li lon, li wile e pona tawa mi.
taso mi pilin e ni: mi awen e moli taso.

tan kalama musi "Waiting to be dead" pi jan J. D. Hart
[more of an interpretation than a translation]

[I wait for death.
Who helps me?
Nobody helps me.
Who tells me the truth?
Nobody tells me the truth.
Maybe something is ruined in my head.b
I think that I wait for death.
Where is love?
Love is not inside me.
What exists?
Only darkness exists.
Maybe god exists and wants good for me.
But I thing that I wait for death only.]
