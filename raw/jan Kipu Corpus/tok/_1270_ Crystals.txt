I didn't make a picture.  But I sang.  For a little while I am bad.  Plus, my computer got the sound badly.  But maybe this song is good.  This song in English is Crystals by teh group Of Monsters and Men.  Good listening!
Lyrics: (but I made some word mistakes in the singing)

	Above the yellow dust, 	A box in the clouds 
	In hope of absolutely nothing 	If I fall, oh!, I go to the ground.  	Oh, me!  I burn	Throw away the skin
	dark 
	Nothing is bright 
	I am a afraid.
	I can know something	I know something
	Uh uh uh uh!
	May the eye be closed
	Feel this music. 	Uh uh uh uh!	May the eye be closed
	Join your color and mine.
	Move the dark dust (need initial 'o').
	The dust moves in the hand.
	My new dark feet are
	Cold, Oh!  My skin feels like a parchment....* **
	Oh! If I am bad,	I know.	but I am good	On the inside	I am in this head	Always 
	Totally (ditto).
trl kipo.




Original:
Lost in skies of powdered gold 
Caught in clouds of silver ropesShowered by the empty hopesAs I tumble down, falling fast to the ground *I know I'll wither so peel away the barkBecause nothing grows when it is dark 
In spite of all my fears, I can see it all so clearI see it all so clear "**Whoa-o-o-o, Cover your crystal eyesAnd feel the tones that tremble down your spineWhoa-o-o-o, Cover your crystal eyesAnd let your colours bleed and blend with mineMaking waves in pitch black sandFeel the salt dance on my handsRaw and charcoal coloured thighs feel so coldAnd my skin feels so paper-thin* **But I'm okay in see-through skinI forgive what is withinBecause I'm in this houseI'm in this homeAll my time**
