[A time like this comes: the machines of the bosses become truly evil and make you sick at heart (?).  So you cannot go along. You cannot even continue to aid the bosses' machine.  Your strong desire is to put your body inside and on the the wheels and on the rods and on the whole machine.  You want to totally stop it.  You want to say to the machine makers and the machine owners that if you are not free, the machines can not work again

"There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part. You can't even passively take part! And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop! And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it  --  that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all!" Mario Savio }
