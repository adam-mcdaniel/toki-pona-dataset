[‎Bram Cools‎

I want
Everybody to be friends.
I want
Everybody to love everybody.

I want
You to love me.
I want to love you.
This is very good.

Everybody is a sibling and a child of God.
Everybody is a sibling and a child of God.

I don't want war.
I don't want destruction.
War is bad.  Destruction is bad.
I want to love. I want to love.

This is good for me
And good for you
And good for everybody.
