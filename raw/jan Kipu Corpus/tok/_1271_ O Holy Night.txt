[ janKulisa 

Holy night! All the stars shine brightly.
At this time, Jesus is born.
Because of evil deeds, all people feel bad.
But he came.  Good came to men.
The feelings of men became very good
Because day has come again.  

Come.  Come down.  Hear the heavenly sounds.
Oh!  This simte is divine.  Jesus goes here.
Oh!  This time is divine.  Jesus is here.

We go to the bed of Jesus.
My happiness shines like the stars.
In the past, wise men travelled similarly
From other countries to the stars same light.
The ruler of the world sleeps here.
He is always my friend.

He knows that we are weak.
See that your leader is here.
See that you friend is here.He helps us.
Love is the way. Peace is the wisdom.
He breaks the evil iron bands.
The poor are brothers of the wealthy.
So I want to sing.
Everybody, sing with me!

He is God!  Praise him!
Talk about the power and love of Jesus!
Talk about the power and love of Jesus!]
