[The tale of the old seaman
There was an old seaman.
He stopped one of three.
With your beard and shining eyes,
Why are you stopping me?

The house door of teh bridegroom  is open.
I am closest relative.
The relatives are present.  The food is present.
You can hear the merry music. 

He held him with his thin hand.
Ah, there was a ship!"
"Crazy white man, take your hand off me."
Directly, he lowered his hand.

He held im with his bright eyes.
The bridegroom's kinsman did not move.
He listened like a child.
The seaman held his will.

The kinsman sat on a stone.
He had to listen.
The old man kept talking.
He was a seam with bright eyes.

"The domestic tlk occurred.  The moving of the harbor occurred. 
We went down on the good path
Below the church, below the hill, 
Below the peak of the lighthouse]






   [It is an ancient Mariner, 
   And he stoppeth one of three. 
   'By thy long grey beard and glittering eye, 
   Now wherefore stopp'st thou me? 
   
   The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide, 
   And I am next of kin; 
   The guests are met, the feast is set: 
   May'st hear the merry din.' 
   
   He holds him with his skinny hand, 
   'There was a ship,' quoth he. 
   'Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!' 
   Eftsoons his hand dropt he. 
   
   He holds him with his glittering eye --  
   The Wedding-Guest stood still, 
   And listens like a three years' child: 
   The Mariner hath his will. 
   
   The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone: 
   He cannot choose but hear; 
   And thus spake on that ancient man, 
   The bright-eyed Mariner. 
   
   'The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared, 
   Merrily did we drop 
   Below the kirk, below the hill, 
   Below the lighthouse top. 
   Coleridge]
