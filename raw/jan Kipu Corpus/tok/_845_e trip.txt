[Marcus Miles
Last night, we got together.  The group consisted of me and my wife and my mother.  I wanted to go to the mountains in the car.  When I went a little way, I thought that I could not go to the mountains.  I thought that, if I went, a lot of would come down from the sky.  Because of that, the highway would be in bad condition.  I felt bad. But I drove home.  In a little while we three were comfortable in the light of Christianity at home.]
