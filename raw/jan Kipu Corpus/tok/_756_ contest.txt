[Marie Elliott
As for the poetry contest, what work brings it on?

Marie Elliott 
Aw! Nobody is talking ...
Didn't a lot of people want a contest?  Now, what's happening?
  
  
  Serge Ganachaud 
  Maybe we couldn't understand your sentence.  Don't write only one sentence.I think that you need to cut this sentence into two or three.
Marie Elliott  
Oh! I'll change that.
People in this group wanted a contest.  Now, what is happening.  Who is writing the rules and the other things for this contest?]
