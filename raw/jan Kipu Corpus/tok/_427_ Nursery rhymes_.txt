toki musi pi jan lili
jan lili Popi li ken ala lukin e mani len ona 
li sona ala e lon ni: ona li kama lukin e mani len ona.  
tan ni la ona li ken e ni: mani li awen taso. 
tenpo kama la mani li tawa tomo li kama monsi e palisa monsi ona

jan lili Mali li jo e mani len lili. linja selo ona li walo sama ko lete.
 jan Mali li tawa ma la mani len kin li tawa ona. 
tenpo suno wan la mani li tawa tomo pi kama sona lon monsi pi jan Mali. 
ni li pakala e lawa. 
ni li kama e ni: jan lili li musi mute tan ni: 
mani lili li lon tomo pi kama sona.


soweli suwi lili ni li tawa esun.
soweli suwi lili ni li awen lon tomo.
soweli suli lili ni li moku e soweli seli.
soweli suwi lili ni li jo e ala.
soweli suwi lili ni li toki e nimi 'mu mu" lon nasin ali pi tawa tomo.





[Children's songs

Little Bo-peep cannot see her sheep
And does not know where she will find her sheep.
So she allows the flock to just go on.
Eventually the flock will come home and bring their tails behind them.

Mary had a lamb.  Its fleece was white like snow.
If Mary went somewhere, the lamb also went there.  
One day, the lamb went to school behind Mary.
This broke the rules.
This caused the children to play a lot because
There was a lamb in the school. 

This little pig goes to market.
This little pig stays home.
This little pig eats cooked meat
This little pig has nothing
This little pig says `mu mu' on the whole path to home. ]
