[Actually a bad man.
He had a ball
And said
"Get to work,
The group entertains the ball."

A man from the land of Elepen
Had two metal balls.
When  the balls moved
And made a loud noise,
Light came from the man's backside.

There once was a man from  Madras
Who had balls made out of brass.
When they clanged together,
They played "Stormy Weather"
And lightning shot out of his ass.]
