[Leo Vrizcraya‎
Someone like you
In the past, I knew that
I could not look at a person like you.
In the past I knew that 
You could not have your love.
Now I look at her
She is a person like you.
Now she and I are friends.
I don't want to discard you.
One day, I go to you
"I want to be alone."
"I don't want to say this"
If she says thi, I feel bad.
So, my feelings are destroyed. ]
