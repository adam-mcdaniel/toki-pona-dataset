[Mathieu Thépaut‎
The Force is always with you
Serge Ganachaud 
With a phone, I can talk with youn.  But without a phone I can talk next to you.  Is this right?

John Clifford 
Oh, you want to use a vehicle to talk beside us.  However, "I tlk on your side" can mean "I agree with you".

Serge Ganachaud 
Good night!

John Clifford
Sleep well! ]
