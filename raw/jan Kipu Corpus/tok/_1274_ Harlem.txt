[Harlem
If a strong desire does not start, what?
Is it like the juice inside a small sweet fruit going away?
Is it like damaged human skin becoming disgusting?
Is it like a piece of dead meat being bad to the nose?
Is it like syrup becoming hard?
Is it like a big thing coming down?
Does a very great fire from inside make evils and destruction and death?

Harlem
BY LANGSTON HUGHEs
What happens to a dream deferred?
Does it dry up
like a raisin in the sun?
Or fester like a sore -- 
And then run?
 Does it stink like rotten meat?
 Or crust and sugar over -- 
 like a syrupy sweet?
  Maybe it just sags
    like a heavy load.
  Or does it explode?
