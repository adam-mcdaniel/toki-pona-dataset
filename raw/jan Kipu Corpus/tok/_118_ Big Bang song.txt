[Everything was hot and in a very small hole.  A long time ago, everything became big.
Keep on.  Earth became cold. Fish ate stones and light.  But these fish came to want to eat plants. People from long ago made tools. We built a big wall and made big homes for dead kings.  Mathematics existed.  Science existed.  History existed.  When we knew nothing, we came to know it.  When there was a big noise, everything came into existence.

(Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state
Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started, wait
The earth began to cool, the autotrophs began to drool
Neanderthals developed tools
We built a wall (we built the pyramids)
Math, science, history, unraveling the mysteries
That all started with the big bang! Hey!)]
