Strangely, toki pona is good for this:  if a person feels bad, he can talk well about his feelings.  toki pona has these many bad words: ike, jaki, moli, utala, monsuta.  It has these few good words: pona, olin.  The old Pije primer had many poems about depression by young people.  Now these writings are still there. 
Death by hanging
I can feel the cord on my head.
I can feel that I am going to darkness. 
I move myself away to be on air.
When the rope ends, I am dead. 


Grain is important to the people of the Philippines
Grain is white.
But grain in the writings is not white.
Grain in the writings comes from the hill country.
If you eat without grain, meal time feels small and bad. 


    My Breath
    
    My breath is fiery.
    My feelings are atumble
    Not a thing remains.My Friend
    
    My friend,
    I like you.
    Where are you?]
