  [toki pona is crazy oh
  Like this water.
  Let's drink well 
  The word water.
  Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh.  Enough!
  My friend want to be in
  A country without bad
  And not know a thing-
  This bad is good! 
  Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh.  Enough!
  Toki pona is crazy 
  Like this water!
  We all drink well 
  The knowledge of words.!]
  
  
  
  
  [The language like this water here,
  Leaves us inebriated,
  So let's all drink in merry cheer
  This wine of words created!
  Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Oh... Way-hey!
  My comrade, he's a-hankering
  To live in gorgeous Eden,
  But if the drink ain't flowing there
  He don't know what he's missin'!
  Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Oh... Way-hey!
  The language like this water here,
  Leaves us inebriated,
  And all the world shall drink in cheer
  This wine of words created!ï»¿]
