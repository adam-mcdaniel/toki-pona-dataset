[For the Feast of Pentecost, Acts of the Apostles, 2: 1-11 (I skipped the names of many countries in 10-11)
When the fiftieth day after Passover came, all the people of the Way gathered together in one room. 
Suddenly, from Heaven, a noise like a mighty wind came and filled the room where they were.
People saw bright divided shafts like fire.  They came to rest on everybody.
The Holy Spirit filled people.  They began to speak in those other languages which the Holy Spirit gave them to speak in.
Now, in Jerusalem many Jews were staying.  These were religious people from every country under Heaven.  
When they heard this, they came together and were confused because everybody heard people of the Way talking to them in their own language. what they say. They were puzzled and questioned and said to one another "Oh, aren't the people speaking Galileans?
How do we hear in our own language what they say?We are people of every language, both Jews and proselytes.We hear these people speaking about the great deeds of God in our own languages."]
