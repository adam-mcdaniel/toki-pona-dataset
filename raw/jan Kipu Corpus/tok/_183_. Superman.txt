[Clark Kent and Lois Lane reported the news.  They were walking the streets of Metropolis and heard this scream. "Oh, help me!" Lois Lane ran toward the sound.  Clark Kent said "I'll go to a phone and send the news to the police."  When he go inside the phone booth, he discarded his clothes and became Superman and lept into the sky and came to the source of the cry. 
Look up! That is a bird.  No.  That is a plane. No.  That is superman.]
