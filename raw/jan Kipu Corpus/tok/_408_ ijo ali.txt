[I published this on Ma Pona Pi Toki Pona.  Now I am publishing it here.  You can feel bad about the syntax in this.  But I want to play with words.  I like this way  for fun sites/talk.  (A little bit about this syntax comes from Wesman.)

Everything.

Is hot air
And cold stone
And running
Then water.

Stone
Is a bright thing
And hot dust
And subterranean water.

Causes destruction
And can give 
light
Then fire.

Air 
Moves upward/the heavens
And is the means of speech
And is the earth's cover. ]

Tell me whether this page is wise or crazy. 

[This works in English, which it pretty slavishly copies, but not in toki pona.  So, THIS IS NOT TOKI PONA and there is nothing in current toki pona that suggest that toki pona will eventually evolve toward this.  It might be interesting to see what one could do in toki pona to get this kind of inversion, but this techniques is against all the flow of toki pona so far.]
