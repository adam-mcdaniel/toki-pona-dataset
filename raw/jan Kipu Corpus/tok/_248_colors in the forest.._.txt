 maybe in the future you (are) us
but seeing the becoming is too complex to do

First, welcome to toki pona!
Moreover, this is very good and good toki pona.  `Ike pali' is very nice.  But maybe you would want to use `lawa' in place of `sewi'.  Maybe not.

We are what you will be, maybe
but it's hard to foresee]
