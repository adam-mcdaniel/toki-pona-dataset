[I often don't talk with this group.  So I give you this song.  
(Secondly, I want to know what you think for this: How does one make a new group of words? I use a dash but what do you think?)
Song: Here comes a thought
From Stephen Universe
Here comes a thought
This feeling is crazy.
Someone talks 
And ruins you.
You do
Something not good.
Your talk
Happens to come!
You don't know 
Your way.
All these little things 
Are big to you.
You are crazy therefore. I can
I can discard you therefore.
Wait!  Know this!
Wait! Become a way!
Wait! Say this:
Are we two finished?
Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. 
Everything is good, good, good, good.
Feel, feel, feel, feel not bad. 
I attract you, you.
A feeling come.
This feeling is crazy
Someone speaks
And ruins me, oh!
 I do
Something not good.
My speech,
My speech comes.
Oh, I don't know 
My way.
All these little things 
Are large to me.
I am crazy therefore.  I can
Discard me therefore
Wait! Know this!
Wait! Become a way!
Wait! Say this:
Are we two finished?
Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.
Everything is good, good, good, good.
Feel, feel, feel feel not bad.
I attract you, you.
This is big.
Nothing is nothing is nothing is nothing.
Everything is good, good, good, good.
We two can see, can see, can see, can see from here,
From here, from here, from here.

[(Take a moment to think of just
Flexibility, love, and trust
Take a moment to think of just
Flexibility, love, and trust)

[Verse 1: Garnet]
Here comes a thought that might alarm you
What someone said and how it harmed you
Something you did that failed to be charming
Things that you said are suddenly swarming

[Pre-Chorus: Garnet]
And, oh, you're losing sight, you're losing touch
All these little things seem to matter so much
That they confuse you
That I might lose you

[Chorus: Garnet]
Take a moment, remind yourself
To take a moment and find yourself
Take a moment and ask yourself
If this is how we fall apart
But it's not, but it's not, but it's not, but it's not, but it's not
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
You've got nothing, got nothing, got nothing, got nothing to fear
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here

[Verse 2: Stevonnie]
Here comes a thought that might alarm me
What someone said and how it harmed me
Something I did that failed to be charming
Things that I said are suddenly swarming

[Pre-Chorus: Stevonnie]
And, oh, I'm losing sight, I'm losing touch
All these little things seem to matter so much
That they confuse me
[Both]
That I might lose me

[Chorus: Both]
Take a moment, remind yourself
To take a moment and find yourself
Take a moment and ask yourself
If this is how we fall apart
But it's not, but it's not, but it's not, but it's not, but it's not
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
I've got nothing, got nothing, got nothing, got nothing to fear
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here

[Bridge: Both]
And it was just a thought, just a thought, just a thought, just a thought, just a thought
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
We can watch, we can watch, we can watch, we can watch them go by
From here, from here, from here

[Outro: Stevonnie]
(Take a moment to think of just
Flexibility, love, and trust
Take a moment to think of just
Flexibility, love, and trust)]
