   [The lovely adventure of Gunho
 
In a valley close to the sea, there was a village. This village had no name, because one did really never need to mention it. Strangers were not very common, however once in a while people came to stay over the night before continuing to one of the towns this village was in the middle of. Here lived a boy called Gunho, and he was a little different from the other children. The other boys and girls used to play together, running around chasing each other or having imaginary adventures with toys they had made themselves, but Gunho preferred to be alone. He was not very interested in playing games but in thinking and exploring. That is all he ever did. When the other children were to be found in the playground you would find Gunho in the bushes somewhere, studying the leaves or the insects on them. He also found a joy in exploring his own mind, tearing it down in to smaller pieces and analyzing every inch of himself. He thought a lot of why he did react in a certain manner in some situations and why he thought like he did. Everything was to be questioned, and he almost always found an answer. Almost.          	
One night he was out in the dark, sitting in a tree and writing some songs, you see he was also interested in music, and he played the traditional instrument of his village  - The Ĥarkav. Being out late like this was nothing unusual to him, he thought it was easier to concentrate and he liked the feeling of sitting high were he could observe others without being seen himself. It was a warm night, like many others in this climate zone. Not as dark tough, as the moon was very bright this night. The songwriting did not work out very well for him, he felt that he had no inspiration. Luckily he had a technique to force himself to write, he just intentionally forgot about quality and wrote whatever came in to his mind. He came up with this idea because he always felt disappointed coming home without having a single line written. He sang his song he had written to try it out;
"I have never felt love, an emotion preserved for they who stand above,
I taste a rock, it tastes like a clock,
Experience comes to they who eat, that's just neat. Wheat. "
It was the most horrible thing he had ever written, but he was proud anyways for his great effort. He was just about to finish and go back home and catch some sleep, when suddenly a mysterious creature appeared in front of him. It just came out of nowhere. At first he did react like anyone else would have. He got really scared and he almost fell down the tree of the chock, but he calmed down quite soon. The creature did not have a very intimidating aura, it was actually quite comfortable and cozy, just like a dog or something. It had a humanoid shape, but it did not seem to be of the same matter as him. It was not beautiful at any rate, it looked like some kind of deep-sea fish in the face. It had skin pale as snow, and something black that covered its body that could be related to as clothes.
   -          Good evening? Gunho greeted to be polite and to check the intelligence of this strange monster, however this kind of pleasantries did not seem to interest him.
   -          I am a creature not widely known by your race. I have been sent to you to give you a task, you have been randomly selected to formulate the human definition of love. When you have decided what to answer, this will apply to humanity in a way that is of no interest for you at this very moment.
   Gunho was a overwhelmed of this very direct and informative way to speak, but it pleased him. It was brief and the message was clear, this monster skipped all unimportant things that dominated the language of Gunho, and he thought that was interesting. The way the monster spoke was the first thing that hit him, the second thing was the interesting opportunity to decide such a thing. That pleased him even more, and he felt like he was the right man to do it.
   -          I have been thinking some about love, he began and leaned back a little to sit more comfortably.
      I have never really experienced it myself, but I have seen it among the others in my village, so I have some perception of it. I have seen that it is quite shallow, and is mostly based on appearance or status. So maybe love is not a deep and too beautiful thing? Maybe it does not exist? That is what I ever have thought. But now, considering your existence, if something sent from Gods or whatever you came from can exist, why cannot there be a meaning of life and maybe even love?
   -          Please do not make any assumptions of that kind. God as you know it is limited to you, and does not stand very high above humanity as it was created when human was. The real God does not have the same moral, intentions or ideas as humans. Would you share bizarre cultural ideas of earthworms?
   Gunho thought through this for a while. It seemed logic. He said out loud what he thought:
   -          I want say that love does not exist, but it might just be because I have never experienced it myself why I feel like this. I do not like any of the boys or girls in my village, they are just not like me. So~, I am going for a big journey to find love. When I have some experience, I shall answer. I hope there is no time limit for me?
   The monsters told him it was nothing to worry about, and so he went on his journey. He packed things necessary for survival and left his family, his village and his life behind him. He knew this was an important quest, and the village was not very stimulating anyways.
   Years passed without him falling in love. He traveled village to village, city to city but no one seemed to please him. He decided to force it, and found himself a very good-looking girl. He did not really love her, but he was at least attracted to her. He learned some useful lessons from this relationship. She was a very dominating girl, and used words to control him and make him feel guilty for various things. She had a very clear image of how her boyfriend should be, and tried to make him fit in to that ideal. He dealt with it, for a while. One day he exploded and left her, and he was very disappointed and happy to be free. It felt like taking of a very heavy backpack you had forgot that you wore, he thought. He left her village, and traveled for years again. This time he would not be that slutty, he said to himself. One day, traveling in a forest, he met a she-wolf. They befriended each other, and after a short time he fell in love. He was really happy with her, and he had really never felt such connection with another. There was one problem though, she was a wolf and she never stayed at one place for a longer time. The wolf, doomed not to let anyone come to close to her because of her old wounds. She had been hurt before, and did not let anyone come inside her walls. At first it would not be strange to feel like being special to her, but she only sought the thrill of temporary relationships. She left Gunho, who thought he had found love. He felt used, like a toy not fun enough to play with more than some days. He left the forests with his heart broken, never to return.
   Once more, years passed and eventually his wounds were healed. In a land far, far away from his village he found an interesting woman. Her name was Tosi. They became very close friends, and he began to like her. However, he approached her very carefully and slowly. He did not want to be hurt again, and wanted to make sure she really was something for him. He realised she was even more fit for him than the wolf, and decided to propose. Right in time, he was invited to her place for a party. This was the perfect opportunity to share his feelings. He came to the party, and very soon he got to know they were actually celebrating Tosi's engagement with a polar bear she apparently was in love with. This came as a sudden kick right in the balls for Gunho. He went totally furious, but he kept his rage inside as well as he ever could. It did not succeed too well, and he drank himself very drunk and rage-partied as he had never done before. It all ended with him getting kicked out by Tosi herself, so he left and never came back.
   Gunho was as mad as he could get, he was so disappointed of love. He decided to answer the monster now, many years had passed and he was a grown man now. He did not need to call out for the monster to come. It just knew he was ready to answer, and appeared in front of him. Not asking what his answer was, just expecting him to know what to say.
   Gunho took a breath, and then began:
   -          Love is a worthless tool to make one happy. It is preserved for they who are stupid enough to live in an illusion of them being in love. Anyone saying they are in love should kill themselves because they are stupid idiots and the world does better without them.
   He nodded to show he was done.
   -          This shall be the definition of love and apply to humanity.
      You are now free from duty.
   The creature disappeared in a way you as a reader prefer, and was never to visit Gunho again. Gunho did not feel the relief he thought he would, but he sat down and cried for a while. It was done now, and he would have said the same thing again. He headed back to his home village, but he was not sure what to do anymore. Love was his hope to find happiness in life, but it had failed him. Now he only wanted to meet his parents again before they died, if they had not already. He returned home, and his parents were both alive and mad for leaving them but happy to see him again. And then he realised how much he loved is parents, and that all love he ever needed was to be find at home all along<3
   No but seriously, he lived his life back in the village. He was never really satisfied with life, but he had never been very happy except those short moments when his relationships actually worked. Somehow he did almost regret his definition of love, he had brought back his more scientific way of thinking. Now he thought that love was something natural, and maybe therefore did not necessarily need to mean sorrow. Why would a bad thing be such a big part of the human mind? And maybe some people where actually happy together, just that he failed himself. Maybe love was not meant for his kind, those seeking truth in life before happiness. Or was love just something weird created by man a long time ago? He thought a lot like this in the rest of his life, always wondering if he made the right decision. He never really came to an answer, and he died alone.   
                                  End of story]
