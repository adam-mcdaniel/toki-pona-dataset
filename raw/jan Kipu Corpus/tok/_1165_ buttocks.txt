    [Rick Miller (rdmiller3) 
    Look at this: buttocks.
    In toki pona.
    
    
    Buttocks.
    Don't look, Siko.  Go! There is nothing.
    The female cause of  voyeurism is not a thing.  She is a person and has feelings... and has a soul
    And has A BUTT.

    Buttocks.
    
    Don't look.  Just go.
    A woman is not a sexual object.  A woman has thought and feelings...
    And A BUTT. ]
