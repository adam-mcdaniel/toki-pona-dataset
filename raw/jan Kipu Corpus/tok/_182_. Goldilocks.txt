[Once upon a time a family of bears lived in a little house in the big woods. The family consisted of a big father and a middling mother and a cub. One day, they all woke up. They made this breakfast: The male bear put oatmeal and water in a big pot and cooked it. When the mixture of granules and water boiled, the female bear put it into three food bowls. The cub put them on the dining table. After that, they went for a walk and had fun in the beautiful woods.
In the neighborhood, lived a girl in a small house. She had shiny blond hair. Therefore, people called her "Goldilocks". On the same day, Goldilocks went walking to the big woods. The child saw the little house and went inside. She saw a dining table and three food bows. Each bowl contained hot cereal and milk. 
Goldilocks ate a little bit from the big bowl, but it was too hot. Then Goldilocks ate a bit from the mid-sized bowl, but it was too cold. Therefore, Goldilocks ate a bit from the little bowl. It was just right. So Goldilocks ate it all. 
After that, she saw three chairs. The child sat on the big chair, but it was too big. The girl sat on the mid-sized chair, but it was also big. Finally, she sat on the little chair. It was just right. But when Goldilocks sat on it, she broke it. 
Then Goldilocks saw three beds. The child lay on the big bed. But it was too hard. She lay on the mid-sized be, but it was too soft. Finally she lowered herself to the little bed. It was just right. So, Goldilocks went to sleep. 
At that time, the bear family came back to their house. They all looked at the inside of their house. The male bear said "Someone has eaten from my bowl" The female bear said the same. The cub said the same and also said "They ate all my cereal". 
The bears looked at their chairs and said "Someone has sat in my chair" . The cub said "They smashed mine too." 
Similarly, the three bears looked at their beds and said "Some has lain on my bed". The cub said "Moreover, she is still on it"
Goldilocks woke up and ran home. ]
