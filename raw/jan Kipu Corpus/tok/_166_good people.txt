[Different people are good.
Disgusting people are good.
Bad people are a little good.
Similar people are bad [or "relatives"]
Pleasant people are bad.
Good people are a little bad.
Everybody is good?
I think that everybody wants good things.  But everybody is a little crazy.  Craziness can be good and can be bad.
[Maybe `wile pona' "want to be good"?]]
