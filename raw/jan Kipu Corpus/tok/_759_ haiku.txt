: 260 John Clifford / : 263 / There are a number of haiku (and near) in : 323 tomolipu.blogspot.com / in a doc called something like 'toki musi pi nasin pi ma Nijon' or so.
1 is very nice "The heavens preserve/the eye of the pale moon/ while below we sleep'. (padded).
2 I'm less sure about because 'namako' just means so many things and isn't much used as a noun but maybe "Heavenly spices/ are the moon and all the stars/ on [someone's?] soft skin" [I would have used 'en' rather than 'li' in this case, for a mixture, and remember that stars are 'mun', too, in tp]
3 is a near and I don't see a good patch for line one, maybe 'jan pilin ale'. Then shifting everything a space along, 'li pini e utala/ la o mi wan a.' ['mi' can be plural, 'o' introducing a wish doesn't need a comma.]. Very nice indeed.

[The heavens preserve
The eye of the pale white moon,
While below we sleep.

A divine dressing
Are the moon and little stars 
On beloved skin.

If human good will
Would put an end to conflict.
Then let us unite.]
