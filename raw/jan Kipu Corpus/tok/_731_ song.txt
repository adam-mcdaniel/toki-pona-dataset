tomo tawa suli li pakala e mi tu la
moli mi li pona mute lon poka sina.
tomo tawa suli li moli e mi tu la
pilin pona ni en ken wan ni li ijo mi.



[If a big vehicle destroys us two,
My death is very good by your side.
If a big vehicle kills us two,
This happiness and this unique permission are mine.

Original:
And if a double-decker bus
Crashes into us
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die .
And if a ten-ton truck
Kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine .}
