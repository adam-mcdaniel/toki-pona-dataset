[Hear the tale of Ali.
Puli created Pinki and king Ali. Puli gave Pinki to Emi.  Emi was the legal father of Pinki.  Pinki was a warrioress and the god Osin.  
The god Osin created Osun.  Osun created Simun and Sini.  
Elimi created Osi.
Simun and Osi mated and created Siku.
Simun and Pinki created Ala.
Uki and Kinki created Kuna and Kulun.
Uki died.
Siku went from Pinki's home to Kuna's home.  He did not return.  
For a long time, Pinki thought "I will go to Kuna's house".  She sent Ala to Emi.  Pinki went to Kuna's house.  
There was much trouble.
Emi heard this trouble.  He did this: Ala went into the tool-box of sound [?].  These two walked. Nobody recognized  them.
In winter, Emi went to the house of two country men.  They were very ugly.  He thinks that maybe these people have money.  Let us two kill them and get their money.  They kill Emi.  The split his instrument. They did not split Ala inside the box. The two countrymen made Ala their serving girl.  
But Ala was very beautiful.  These two were very ugly. So they shit on Ala's skin.  So Ala was Kaka in this house.
