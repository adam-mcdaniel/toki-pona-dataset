[Song  Hello by Adele
Hello, it's me.
I want to know 
Whether you will get together
And talk about everything..
People say "Time heals people"
But i am not healed.
Hello, can you hear?
I am in California and thinking about
Us in the past when we were young and free.
I forget that
We ruled everything.
Many differences are between me and you
 And great distances too.
Hello, I am on the other side.
Many times I telephoned you
To feel bad because the damage to you
Because of my evil deeds.
 But when I called
You were not there.
Hello, I am on the outside,
I can say that I tried
To say that I was sorry for
Your pain.
But it is not important 
Because this doesn
Cut you.]

Hello
Adele
Hello, it's meI was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meetTo go over everythingThey say that time's supposed to heal yaBut I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear meI'm in California dreaming about who we used to beWhen we were younger and freeI've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between usAnd a million miles
Hello from the other sideI must have called a thousand timesTo tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've doneBut when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outsideAt least I can say that I've triedTo tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heartBut it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore]
