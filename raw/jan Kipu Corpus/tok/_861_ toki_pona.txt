John Clifford ala. ike. open la 'jan li toki ike kepeken/lon toki pona' Unless you mean "A person speaks poorly a good speech" which is what your further remarks suggest: but 'toki ike pi toki pona (can't have 'e' in the subject) li sama ala sama ...' "Is speaking a good speech poorly the same as speaking a bad speech well?" (probably not)

John Clifford [can't figure out 'toki sama pilin' "emotional similar speech" then 'mi jan ala pi pana pona pi sona pi toki pona' 'jan ante pi (lon) kulupu ni li ken pali e pona tawa sina.' 'sina kama sona e pali la sina ken ...'

Kévin Morel-Fourrier I put "e" instead of "pi" for the confusion between "good language/speak" and "Toki Pona". The purpose of this joke was confusion, as there are many possible interpretations.As for "toki sama pilin", I propose it as a translation of "sincerely", as sincerity is telling the same as we think. 

John Clifford A well-motivated move, since the language name almost never goes after 'e', but, alas, many people put it there, so I am too used to correcting that. And, of course, 'e' can't go into a noun phrase (byt the rules so far -- and later changes still wouldn't allow just this construction). On the other hand, "speaking toki pona' would be 'toki pi lon toki pona' (or 'kepeken') so not strictly confusing with "good speech" -- but the same people who use 'e' with the language name don't use 'kepeken/lon' so that doesn't help.

John Clifford Ahah! 'toki pi sama pilin'. Not bad at all, though a 'kepeken' in front might help, but is often lost.


Kévin Morel-Fourrier I totally agree with you, however I always found "mi toki e toki pona" as a translation for "I speak toki pona".

John Clifford Yes. I think that goes back to Pije (and so, probably, to an earlier Sonja). It has not been community standard for many (in tp terms) years, with 'kepeken tp' well-established and 'lon' supported by Sonja. The direct object of 'toki' is what is said, not what that is about nor who it is said to nor in what language it is said.


Kobi Kai Calev 'case' related semantics are so arbitrary in a way (look at how they shift across indo-european). if Toki-Pona is needed to be treated as a 'Pidgin' as Sonja claims in the last few years (refusing to creolify) - these semantics can be best left unspecified (as most of them are actually, most verbs - not to mention compound verbs, don't specify their accusative use nor with other possible prepositions, and whether they are valid intransitively etc) - then the semantics can be worked out in any social context.

John Clifford Not sure of the point here? I suppose you you could call 'e' a case marker in some semantic system, but it is just a grmmatical marker and has fairly definite uses with each verb (though very different ones with different verbs). tp is, of course, not a pidgin or a creole in any linguistic sense, though Sonja like to think that these have specific grammatical and semantic characteristics (which they don't, really) which tp shares. The restrictions on the DO of 'toki' is discovered empirically by looking at community practices (admittedly sloughing off outliers like newbies and and strict constructionists from old grammars).

Kobi Kai Calev interesting. do you have a list of the DO semantics of the verb-list (empirically found that is). And is there any corpora of spoken TP to actually study this on? I mean, the point is - and friend and I - are using Toki-Pona for the last decade - and our semantics are slightly different and seem to be biased by the DO semantics of our native tongues (Hebrew vs Russian).

John Clifford As for corpora, there is the one searchable at tokipona.net, which is fairly complete to 2009. I have one that is pretty thorough from 2009 on but which I haven't organized or put out on some website. There is nothing, so far as I can find, for spoken tp, including that there are very few records or transcripts from any period. This is a serious flaw and probably now uncorrectable for the past, but I have hope that the several talk sites will start correcting for the future. The DO semantics of most verb has not been spelled out; 'toki' is peculiar because it led to a number of early controversy and eventually to a set of consensus solutions.

[Kévin Morel-Fourrier
Someone speaks a good speech poorly.  Does this person speak well and speak poorly? 

Kévin Morel-Fourrier 
Is speaking a good speech poorly the same as speaking a bad speech well?
Ha ha!  This is a matter for a lot of wise thought.
Sincerely,I think that I am not a terson to teach toki pona well.  Other people in this group can help you.  In every way, if you learn this feat, you can cheer up with this because I speak this speech playfully.
