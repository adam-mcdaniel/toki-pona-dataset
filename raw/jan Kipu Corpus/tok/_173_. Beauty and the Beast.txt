A poor man was traveling in the woods. He lost his way. He came to a castle. He knocked on the door. The door opened. He went in. There were a fire and food. He ate and fell asleep. When he awoke, there was a monster with him.
The monster said "I want to eat you. But, if you give me your most valuable possession, I will set you on the path to your home."
The man said "I have nothing. What can I give you?" 
The monster said "You have a daughter. You adore her, Give her to me."
Several time the man said "No!". But he did not want to die. So, finally he said "I will give her to you."
Immediately, he came to his house and saw his child. Slowly, he told the child that he did not want to die and so had told the monster that his daughter had to go to the monster. The child kissed her father and said "I also don't want you to die. So I will go to the monster." She went. The man cried a lot.
In the castle, the woman found good food and fine clothes and piles of crap. She ate the food. She wore the clothes. She washed away the crap and cleaned the whole house. But for a long time she did not see the monster. Finally, the monster bathed, and ate with the woman. The two talked. The woman was wise and good. The monster too. After a long time, she said "Let my father come here." He allowed.
When the news arrived, the father was very happy because his daughter was not dead and was happy. So he went to the castle. He embraced his child and cried a lot. He said "How does the monster treat you?" The child replied "He talks to me and gives me good things and treats me like a perfect gentleman. I love him." 
When she said this there was a terrific noise. A handsome prince came into the room. He said "I used to be a monster. Long ago a wizard made me a monster because of his hatred. Now I have become myself again, thanks to the love of this woman."
The woman and the prince were married and lived happily ever after.]
