[The first lines of two great works of antiquity. 
Wrath! Muse, sing about that of Achilles the son of Peleus. That damned wrath sent great evil to very many men of Achaea and placed many very strong men in Hades.Implements and men of war, I sing about them. These men were first of those that came away from the shores of Troy and came to Italy, to the shores of Lavinia.]
