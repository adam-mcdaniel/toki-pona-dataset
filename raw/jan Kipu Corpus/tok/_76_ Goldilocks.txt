76a

[Once upon a time, a family of bears lived in a cottage in a big woods. The family had a big father, a mid-sized mother and a cub.  One day they woke up early.  They made breakfast thus: the male bear put oatmeal and water on the stove and cooked it.  When the meal and water boiled, the female bear put it into three cereal bowls. The cub put them on the table.  Then they walked and enjoyed the beautiful woods.

In the neighborhood, a girl lived in a cottage. This girl had bright yellow hair, so people called her `Goldilocks'. That same day, Goldilocks walked into the big woods. The child saw the cottage and went inside.  She saw the table and the three bowls.  All the bowls contained hot cereal and milk.

Goldilocks ate a little bite from the big bowl. But it was really hot.   After that, Goldilocks ate a little bite from the mid-sized bowl. But it was really cold.  So, goldilocks ate a little bite from the little bow.  It was just right.  So Goldilocks ate it all.

After that, the girl saw three chairs. The child sat in the big chair but it was really big.  She sat in the midsized chair but it was big too.  Finally she sat in the little chair.  It was just fine.  But when she sat in it, she broke it.  

After that, Goldilocks saw three beds.  She lay on the large bed. But it was like a rock.  She lay on the midsized bed.  But it was like fluff. Finally, she lay down on the little bed.  It was just right.  So Goldilocks fell asleep.

At that time, the family of bears came back to their house.  They all looked at the inside of teir house. Father Bear said "Someone ate from my bowl!"  Mother Bear said the same.  Little Bear said the same and added "They ate all my cereal" too.  

The bears saw their chairs and said "Someone sat in my chair.".  Little Bear said "They even broke it."

Similarly, the ears looked at their beds and said "Someone lay on my bed.".  Little Bear said "Moreover, she is on it now"

Goldilocks woke up and went home quickly.]
