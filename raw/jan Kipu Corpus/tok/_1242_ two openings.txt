People and Death
One
"Don't talk!" The bad man tossed me clear to the building wall.  My back hit the building wall and made a noise. Ouch! He is bad.  In my thoughts, I cannot walk.  I don't want to know this.  I want to be big.  I am like a rock.  But I want to end this.  I want to finish!  The bad man came again.  If I didn't speak, my bodily pains would come again.  
`Stop!"  The bad man stayed like ice.
"What?" 
"I am talking"
The bad man glanced at his phone. I thought that he didn't understand.  But, in Oregon, bad men all don't understand.  

Brave tailor
There is the country off Isala. This country is big and strong.  Many people come to it and work in it and live in it.  The stone houses of Isala are in the round center of of this country.  On one highway from these stone houses, there is a little town.  This village is Ta.  It is little.  But in this town, people are good and want to really help other people.  All are good.  Everybody works and does well and does not want luxuries.]
