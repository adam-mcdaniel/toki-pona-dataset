[Gilgamesh is the king of Uruk
The was the city of Uruk. The walls of Uruk were high and thick. These walls were stone. Enana was the temple of the goddess Inana. The walls of Enana were stone. These walls were white as the sun. Oh, go to temple Enana. Look! Another people did not build buildings like this. Another king did not make buildings like this. Who had all this built? Gilgamesh was the king of Uruk. He had these tall buildings and these walls built. He was great. Gilgamesh fought like a wild beast. He destroyed stone walls. He led his troops. He was king. Who could be like him? Who could say "I am the king"?
The goddess Ninsun and King Lugulbanda were his parents. But creation goddess Aruru improved his body. One part of him was human; two parts divine. He was large and good looking. Gilgamesh was strong like a god. No one wanted to fight him.
The people of Uruk felt bad because of Gilgamesh. Many people went to the temples and said "Oh, gods! Gilgamesh is great and wise. He is strong. His name is great. When Gilgamesh gather the men, he leads them to war. So many parents are sad. Isn't Gilgamesh a bad king? Gilgamesh snatches women and has sex with them. So, many parents cry. Isn't Gilgamesh a bad king?"

Enkidu, the wild man.
The gods heard this. An led the gods. He spoke thus to the creation goddess Aruru: "In the past you made a man. Make a new mighty man. Make a man like Gilgamesh. I want him to fight Gilgamesh. Thus the people of Uruk can live in peace.
Aruru wet her hands. She got clay and flung this stuff on plain. In this way , Enkidu came to be. Enkidu was big and strong. His body was covered with hair. He and the beasts ate grass. He and the beasts drank water. Enkidu was a wild man. He did know about tools or buildings or other people.

The hunter
There was a hunter in this country. He dug big pits. If a beast fell into the pit, he could catch it. He made snares, too. He caught beasts and killed them. But Enkidu destroyed his pits and his snares. He caused the beasts to be able to get away.
The hunter saw mighty Enkidu and felt bad and weak. He left and went to his father. The hunter said "Father, a wild man has come from the mountains. He is big and strong. Nobody is as strong as him. I feel bad. He and the beasts eat grass. He and the beasts drink water. He always destroys my pits and snares. I can't catch any beasts because of him."
His father said "My child, Gilgamesh is in Uruk. Nobody is as strong as him. Go!. Come to Uruk. Tell Gilgamesh about this wild man. Gilgamesh will send the temple prostitute Shamkat to you. Later, Shamkat will defeat this wild man with sex.  
The hunter came to Uruk. Gilgamesh listened to him and said "Hunter, take the temple prostitute Shamkat Later, she will use her feminine wiles on this wild man. A little after, his beasts will leave him."
 The herdsmen slept peacefully.


The temple woman.
The hunter and Shamkat went toward the plain. After a few days, they arrived at the plain. They waited. The next day, the beasts and the wild man Enkidu came. Enkidu ate grass and drank water with the beasts. He liked water and grass.  
Shamkat saw Enkidu, the wild man, and went toward him. She discarded her clothes. Shamkat touched Enkidu's arm. Shamkat seduced Enkidu. Enkidu had sex with Shamkat. For many days, they had sex. For many nights, they had sex. When they finished having sex, Enkidu looked toward the beasts. But the beast were distrustful toward him. So the beast went away. Enkidu wanted to go to the beasts, but he felt weak. He could not run.
Enkit realized that he could understand. Enkidu thinks: "I can undeerstand. I think, I am a human being" He went to Shamkat and bowed down. He looked at her face and listened.
Shamkat spoke to Enkidu and said "Enkidu, you are like a god. Why do you go with beasts?. Come."

Enkidu
Shamkat cut her clothes in two. She dressed Enkidu in one portion. Shamkat said "Come with me. Come to human society." 
They went to a camp of herdsmen. Many herdsmen came together and looked at Enkidu and said "He is as big as Gilgamesh. He is as strong as the sun of An." They offered bread and beer. Enkidu didn't eat; he only stared. He had never seen bread or alcohol. Shamkat said "Enkidu, eat this food; drink this drink. This is the human custom." Enkidu ate a lot of bread. he drank a lot of beer. He felt very good. He washed his body. He got dressed. He was really human. While the herdsmen slept, Enkidu did not sleep. He got weapons and fought b

Gilgamesh's dream.
Gilgamesh dreamed. He awoke and went to his mother. He said "Mother, in the night I had a dream. I saw many stars above me, The star of An fell next to me. I wanted to lift this stone, but I couldn't move it. The people of Uruk surrounded meteorite. I bowed to it jst like I bow to women. I tell you about this so that you can explain this dream."
Gilgamesh's mother knew everything. The goddess Ninsun understood everything. She interpreted this dream and said "My son, your dream is this: a mighty man will come to you. He is as strong as the star of An. You will like him. He will help you and fight your enemies. He will be your brother. You will love him like a sweeheart. My son, your dream is good and important."

The lover.
Enkidu looked around and saw a man walking. Enkidu said "Shamkat, I want that man to go away. Why is he wandering?" Shamkat said "Stranger, why are you walking. You look lie a man who feels bad. Why doi you feel bad?"
The man spoke to Enkidu and said "In a little while, I and my beloved will wed. But Gilgamesh is the king. Alas, he want to have sex with my beloved. On the wedding night, Gilgamesh will have sex with my beloved. This is the custom of the gods: on the wedding night, the kind can have sex with another man's wife."
Enkidu was furious because of the man's story. He said "I am going to Uruk. Gilgamesh will not have sex with your wife."
Enkidu and Shamkat went toward Uruk.

Battle
Enkidu traveled on the road to Uruk; Shamkat traveled behind him. Enkidu was in the plaza of the city. Many people gather around him and said "This man comes from the mountains. He is strong. He is as big as Gilgamesh. Enkidu came to the ouse of the bride. Hestayed in front of the door of that house. He rested a foot on the wall of that house.  
Gilgamesh came. But he could not get into the house. He was furious. Gilgamesh stated to fight Enkidu. Enkidu fought Gilgamesh. The two of them fought. The frame of the door trembled! They fought wildly. The frame of the door shattered! They foughtlike wild beasts. The walls of the house shook!
Two brothers 
Gilgamesh finished his wild fury and stopped fighting. Enkidu spoke to him and said "Gilgamesh, no body is like you. You are as strong as a god. Your parents made you strong. The god Enlil made you king. Gilgamesh, stop abusing the people of Uruk. They are not enemies of yours. You are their king."
Gilgamesh said "You advise is wise and good. You are big and strong. Only you cn say that your are like me. No other person can say this. Be my brother." Enkidu spoke to Gilagamesh and said "You are my brother, too." Enkidu kissed Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh kissed Enkidu. The two became brothers indeed.]
