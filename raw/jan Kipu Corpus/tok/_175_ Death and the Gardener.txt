Once upon a time, there was a gardener in the king's garden. When he saw Death at the foot of a tree, he was afraid. He ran to the king and said this:
"Oh, king! Oh, king! Oh, king! Help me to get away from Death. I saw the evil dark Death at the foot of a tree. He threatened me. O king, give me a vehicle. I am your gardener. So, do this. I need only a vehicle. Using it, I will go away from this country."
When he heard this, the king said:
"Gardener, your speech is good. I am the king. So, I give you a vehicle. May your trip mean much good and not disaster."
When he said this, the king helped the gardener. In a little while, the gardener got a very good vehicle from the king's workmen. Then the gardener went away to a different country.
At that time, the king wanted to see Death. When he went to the garden, he saw Death at the foot of a tree. (Moreover, he saw the recent death of the tree.) The king said this to Death:
"Oh, Death! Oh, person of great darkness! Oh, person of divine law! You are very mighty. But I am very weak. I am your child and your servant and your conquest. I bow down to you. Oh Death, tell me your reason for being here. When I hear this, I will go away."
Death was pleased by the king's speech, so he said this:
"My purpose is not evil. Before I knew that your gardener was here, I was in this country. Before that, I thought that I would kill your gardener today in a country far away from here. But he was here. I did not make a threatening approach to him. I just wanted to talk to him. But now he is far from your home. I can kill him in a country far from this one."
When Death said this, he went away from the king.
Everything dies. All the time, Death continues. Occasionally, if a man wants to escape from death, he makes his own death.]
