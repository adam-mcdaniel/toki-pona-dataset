[ Naja was a woman in the Amazon jungle. She had heard the story that, when the moon loved a woman, he changed her into a moon. Many warriors love Naja, but she wanted only the moon's love. 
At night she looked at the moon with great love. When the moon moved, she moves the same way. When the mere sun arose again, she followed the moon with all her strength. Every night she kept on in the same way. Naja's body sickened from this. But she didn't stop loving the moon.
It happened that she became weak and fell asleep on the edge of the water. An image of the moon appeared in the water. Naja got up and saw the image and thought that the moon had come for her. But in the end, she couldn't see the image. She was dead in the water.
The moon felt bad about the death of Naja. The moon granted her a boon and changed her into a moon. But this moon is different from the moon in the sky. This moon is in the water and is a water lily and has a flower with a pleasant odor. This flower opens only at the rising of the moon.]
