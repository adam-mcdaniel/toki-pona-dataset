[tenpo suno "day" (bright time) (also for 24 hour day) [idiom]
tenpo pimeja "night" (dark time) [idiom]













When, in the beginning, God was making the heavens and the earth,
earth was chaotic and empty;
darkness was on the face of the deep;
the spirit of God was on the face of the water.
God said "May light exist"
Light existed.
God saw that light was good.
God separated light and darkness.
He called light "day"
He called darkness "night"
Darkness came.
Light came.
That was day one.

God said "Let there be an expanse inside the water and divide the water." 
God created the expanse. It divided the water below the expanse from the water above the expanse. 
This happened.
God called the expanse "sky"
Darkness came. 
Light came. 
That was the second day.

God said "Let the water below the sky come together in one place. Let dry ground appear." 
This happened. 
God called the dry ground "earth" and the collected water "sea"
God saw that this was good.
God said "Let earth yield tender plants and these plants: Plants yield seed. Trees yield fruit with seeds inside of their own type." 
The earth yielded tender plants and plant that dispersed seeds of their own kind and trees that bore fruit with seeds inside of their own kind. 
God saw that this was good. 
Darkness came. 
Light came. 
This was the third day.

God said "Let there we a light in the sky to separate the day from the night, to mark seasons and days and years and to lighten the world" 
This happened.
God made two great lights. The greater light was to rule the day. The lesser light and the stars were to rule the night. God placed these lights in the sky to light the world and rule day and night and separate light from darkness.
God saw that this was good.
Darkness came. 
Light came. T
his was the fourth day.

God said "Let the water be filled with living creatures in swarms. Let birds fly on the face of the sky." 
There are living creatures that crawl and that collect a lot in water. God made great monsters and these creatures and birds with wings according to their kind. 
God saw that this was good.
God blessed them and said "Give birth to many and multiply and fill the seas. May the birds multiply on the earth."
Darkness came. 
Light came. 
This was the fifth day.

God said "May the earth bring forth living things according to their kind and domestic animals and crawling animals and beasts of the earth, each according to their kind." 
This happened. 
God made the beasts according to their kind and the domestic animals according to their kind and the crawling things according to their kind. 
God saw that this was good. 
God said "Let me make humans like my image according to my likeness. May they rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the sky and all the flocks of the earth and the crawling things on the earth." 
God made man like his image. In a similarity to God he made him. He made male and female. God blessed them and said "Bring forth many and multiply and fill the earth and subdue the land and rule over the fish of the esea and the birds of the sky and everything that crawls on the earth." God said "Look! To you I give all the plants that sow seed on the face of the earth and all the trees with seed-bering frut to eat, and all the beasts and all the birds of the sky and all the crawling thins that have the breath of life and all green plants, to eat." 
This happened. 
God looked at all his works and saw that they were very good.
Darkness came. 
Light came. 
This was the sixth say.

Sky and earth and the things in them were finished. Before the seventh day, God finished his work and stopped working before the seventh day. God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because on that day he finished all his planned work.]
