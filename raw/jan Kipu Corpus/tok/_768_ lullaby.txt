Mikołaj Musiał 
Gleb! sitelen ni li pona mute mute mute! sina li jan pi sona mute!



[My sleep song.

Oh, I put the child to sleep.
Two eyes want to close.
Sleep time for everyone.
But the moon wants to work.
The child sleeps, sleeps soundly.
Everybody, don't awaken him.

This writing is really extremely good.  You are a very smart person.]
