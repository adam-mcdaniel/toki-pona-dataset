[A thing is many and one.
Many things are me.
I am a group of things.
I am a thing.
I am in a group of things.
I am many.  I am one.
I am a finished thing.  I am one of a group of things.
The group is a finished thing. The group is one thing in a large group.
The large group is a finished thing.  Everything.

I like this amusing talk,.
Everything is a little thing of many very littles.
I am a group of many little things too.]
