Joshua Birns-Sprague

ijo ale li ken kama ante.
kiwen li ken kama ni: ko li ken kama ni: telo li ken kama kon.
sama la kon li ken kama ni: telo li ken kama ni: ko li ken kama kiwen.
kiwen li ken kama kon.
taso ijo ale li ken ala kama ala.
ijo ala li ken kama ala.


[Everything can become different.
A stone can become this.  Powder can become that. Water can become air.
Similarly, air can become this. Water can become that. Powder can become stone.
Stone can become air.
But everything cannot become nothing.
Nothing can become nothing.]
