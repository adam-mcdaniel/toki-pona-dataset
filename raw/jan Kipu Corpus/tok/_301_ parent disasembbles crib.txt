[The parent makes the bedroom of the child many
[misses "crib", could mean makes many bedrooms, rather than makes many things out of a bedroom]
... finishes the bed ...
[more like final assembly than dismantling.]
... destroys the bed ...
[not perfect for "crib" destructions seems to be too strong for "disassemble"]
... unmakes the sleeping box ..
[Better "crib" but can be read as just never assempling]
... disunites the sleeping box ...
[again can be read as just not ever putting it together.]
... causes the sleeping box of the new person to not exist
[probably not jan sin if the crib is coming down.  `Lon ala' is too strong probably and also can't be taken as just not building in the first place.]
