A:
Hanging
I can feel a rope around my neck
I can feel myself headed for darkness
I fly away
When the rope goes taut, I am dead
 [I wasn't sure how to express a rope going taut in TP, so the closest I could think of was "the rope has ended"]

B
 
My soul has been burned
My feelings have been destroyed
Nothing has remained.

C:
My friend,
You are so kind to me
Where are you?

D:
Trapped in darkness*
I wait alone
For your love

*lit. I am in darkness

E:
I Want to Kill

I want to kill you
With a knife
As I strike at you
Blood flows

You ask me
"Why do you kill?"
My life is screwed because of you
You are an enemy

I have killed your friends
The Snake* and The Man-Bitch
Their deaths are good indeed
Their dicks have been cut off

You look at me
Fear is in your eyes
Before, I was in your hands
Now your life is in my hands

Again I stab you,
Again blood flows
You move not, you speak not
Now my suffering is no more

*In the Philippines, traitors can be idiomatically referred to as snakes.
F:
The Bell Ringer
In the bell tower,
He sends out a sound.
We can hear a good sound.
The child comes here.
The child has a burned hand.
His only food is rice.
When rest comes, sadness comes. 
When bedtime comes, sadness comes. 
Every day, he sends out The Good Sound.
Every night, they see that person* and give to him
The moon and stars are sad for him.
He wants love in this land


G:
The Girl with the Book*

You are alone in the room.
You hold a book in your hand. 
The sun is on your hair.
You are pretty. 
But you are very beautiful because
I want to get to know you
and to hold your hand.
All in all, I want to be by your side
The girl has a book.

*The TP and EN titles are different. This is intentional. I feel each title best summarizes their respective translations

H:
Teahouse

People come and go
Time comes and goes
My milk tea is finished
But my feelings for you remain
