[One ring rules them all.

Three rings went to the rulers of the Elves who are under the sky.
Seven rings went to the rulers of the Dwarves who are in stone dwellings.
Nine rings went to humans who have to die.
One ring went to the dark lord who is one his dark throne.
This is in Mordor, where the shadows lie.

One ring rules them all.
One ring finds them all.
One ring brings them all and unites them in darkness.
This is in Mordor, where the shadows lie.

One Ring to Rule Them All

                                    English
                                       
                                       
Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,


Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,


Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,


One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne,


In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie,


One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them,


One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them


In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.]
