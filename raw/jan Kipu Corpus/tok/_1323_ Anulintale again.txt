[Jon Tibbitts
Anulintale by tolkien.  First short section.
.
There was Enu.  He was the one god.  The people of Arda made a name and gave it to him: Ilu'vatar.
In the beginning, Ilu'vatar made many big and divine men.  These were the Ainur.  The mother of the Ainur were the thoughts of Ilu'vatar.  There was all time.  There was all space.  But the Ainur were already next to Ilu'vatar.  Ilu'vatar talked to the Ainur and gave them the technique for singing beautifully for him.  The Ainur were in front of Ilu'vatar and sang beautifully .  Ilu'vatar liked this a lot.  
For a long time, one Ainur or a few Ainurs jang.  The other Ainurs listened.  One Ainur knew a piece of the thoughts of Ilu'vatar.  Another Ainur knew another piece of these thought.  The pieces of the thoughts of Ilu'vatar were the sources of these Ainur.  The Ainurs came to know their many siblings.  This knowledge grew slowly.  When they continued to listen, they got knowledge.  This knowledge became great.  The Ainurs became unified and improved.


 "There was Eru, the One, who in Arda is called Ilúvatar; and he made first the Ainur, the Holy Ones, that were the offspring of his thought, and they were with him before aught else was made. And he spoke to them, propounding to them themes of music; and they sang before him, and he was glad. But for a long while they sang only each alone, or but few together, while the rest hearkened; for each comprehended only that part of the mind of Ilúvatar from which he came, and in the understanding of their brethren they grew but slowly. Yet ever as they listened they came to deeper understanding, and increased in unison and harmony."]
