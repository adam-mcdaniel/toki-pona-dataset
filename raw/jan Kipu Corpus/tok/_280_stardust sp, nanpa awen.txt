[We are all made of stardust.
But the moon is made of blue planet dust.  Ha ha ha!
But this is true: the sun and moon and blue earth and people exist because of a numerical constant of super tiny bodies "a" (1/a ~= 137).  This holds for everything. If the numerical constant "a" were a little different, everything would not exist.)
What does `nanpa awen' mean?
Now I know.  The circle number pi is also a numerical constant.
`nanpa awen'
Is a constant time valeu.
Is a time value of a constantly loving man.
Is a time value?
Is a knowing number?
Is a numerical constant.
Is a monetary value.
Is a number. ] ]

  Kacper Sokołowski >> -- What is "the amount of waiting" a knowledge of?
  -- The amount of waiting... It's an amount of awaitened time, an amount of time of waiting for the beloved one; but is it at all an amount of time? Maybe it's amount of knowledge, maybe amount of waiting, an amount of resources? Maybe just an amount, in general. I consider everything as an amount. <<
