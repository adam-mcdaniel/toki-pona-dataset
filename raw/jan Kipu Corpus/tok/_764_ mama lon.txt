[Joshua Birns-Sprague


Existence is the mother of the main things of nonexistence.
Nonexistence is the mother of the main things of existence.
Good is the mother of the main things of evil.
Evil is the mother of the main things of good.
Bigness is the mother of the main things of smallness.
Smallness is the mother of the main things of bigness.
I know the high and the low because these two are not the same.
If many noises are in the same place, the many noises become one.
If something is in front to be seen, everything else is therefore behind.]
