[I want to know Christ
And the power of his discarding death
And my union with his suffering,
So that I am like him 
In his death.
Thus, I get discarding death 
By some means I don't understand.

"I want to know Christ -- yes,to know the power of his resurrectionand participation in his sufferings,becoming like him in his death,and so, somehow,attaining to the resurrection from the dead."Philippians 3:10,11 (NIV)]
