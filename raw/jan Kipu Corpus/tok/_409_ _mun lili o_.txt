"mun lili o"

suno li lon sewi ona.
luka ona li lon luka mi.
pilin pona.
sike tu li sike tawa.
pilin suli a! tan ona li
olin wawa.

meli suwi o
kute e mi.

mi wile lukin
e sinpin meli
li wile pilin
e selo seli.

mun lili o
lawa e mi.

mi wile sona
e ale sina
li wile lape
lon poka sina.

linja loje en oko laso 
en selo walo: ni li meli mi.
kule waso.
ona li jan pona pona.
ona taso li ken lon e mi.
jan wan li ona a!



[O little star

The sun is in its sky.
Its hand is on my hand.
Good feeling.
Two years circle forward.
O, a great feeling! Its cause
Is strong love.

Sweet woam
Listen to me.

I want to see
A woman's face
And want to feeL
Warm skin.

Little star,
Lead me.

I want to know
Everything about you
And want to sleep
By your side.

Red hair and blue eyes
And white skin: that is my woman.
Bird colored.
She is a wonderful person.
Only she can place/create me.
One person is she, oh!]
