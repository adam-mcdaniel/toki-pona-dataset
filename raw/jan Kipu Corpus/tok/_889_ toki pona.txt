  o pali pona, la sina ken toki pona!


John Clifford pona. taso 'mi pilin ike e ijo pi tomo sona' I think -- but am not at all sure. I suppose you mean "I feel bad about school" and 'supa', which is a noun, so doesn't fit here, is not the way. But I am not confident what is the way ("about" has been a problem for a decade or so at least). 

Joseph Gary Engelhardt or "mi pilin ike tan ijo pi tomo sona." 

na wile toki e ni. sina wileMatt Groening si toki e toki pona? anu sina wile e ante. anu "wile toki pona" li ijo. mi sona ala e ijo ni. ... I agree with John in that "supa" is quite confusing... though im still a learner and i first did not think "tomo sona" is the common way of saying "school". Though "e" does not occur in English it has words like "the" and "a" to separate it from the verb and lots of endings to while toki pona really needs those little grammatical words like li , e, pi , .... Just think of saying "mi sona e jan" means "I know a person" , "I know someone" ...
