Asking him "How is he?"
Is like a double-edged sword
I'm happy that you're fine with him
But also sad because you might forget me

[You are not my child
But when you are away I think that
My child is dead.
My genuine bad feeling becomes big
Because you are not here.
==
I am in bed
My hand wants to touch your hand,
But your hand is not her.
I am totally alone.
===

I am not your father
But when you discard this country [are away from here]
I feel that
My child is dead.

I cry a lot
Because i want you
At my side.
I don't feel the same [myself?]

When I see your good feelings
I feel good.
But only bad feelings exist
Because you are not here.

I am not your father
But my good for you
Is like my good for my child.
You are my child.
====

If your parents want 
You to go to a hard school, 
A part of my spirit dies. 
===

Good feelings are in my mouth again
But disaster is not far off
Because when I am in church
I shed my tears.
==

In every way, I want good for you
But there is evil.
===

I want
Someone to say to me that
Everything is good because 
Everything has darkness.
===

My child, 
How do you feel?
Do you know me?
Because my feelings do not discard you [thoughts are not far from `tan' you?]
===

Your name
Is the source of my misfortune
If I know your name
My feelings are your desire [? wile e sina' ?]
Because now
You are not here.
===

If I say "How is the child?" to him, 
This is like a terrible sword.
If you feel good, I feel good.
But I feel bad because you withdraw your knowledge from me.
["You forget me" is more `sina weka e mi tan lawa/pilin']
===

If I am in the city,
I see you.
For a little while, I go to you.
I say your name
I encircle you in my arms
And shed tears.
There are many good feelings in my feelings.

But my sleep is ended.
I am totally alone in my bed.
===

I can talk to you.
I can touch you.
I can help you.
I can become your great friend.
I can do this because of you.
But I can do this in my head.
===

The sky is blue
There are white clouds.
But my sky is black.
There are dark clouds.

I feel cold. I feel damp.  [`lete pilin, telo pilin']
I am totally alone.
Yesterday, you were my sun.
Today that person is the cause of rain.
===

If you talk to him
I die a little.
Your feelings are in his hands
But my feelings are in your hands.
===

Three months are past.
What [needs `e'] do you know?
Now I don't have tears
Because I gave them to you.
===

I have a message.
I want to say this to you
But I cannot speak this message.
I love you.
