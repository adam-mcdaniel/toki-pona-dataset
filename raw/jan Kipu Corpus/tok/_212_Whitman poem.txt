mi ante toki e toki musi pi jan Walu Wituman.
_ kama sona mi li open _ 
kama sona mi li open la tawa noka nanpa wan li pona mute tawa mi.
sona lon taso. selo mute ni. wawa tawa.
pipi anpa anu soweli anpa. pilin mute. lukin. olin.
tawa noka nanpa wan a li wawa li pona mute tawa mi.
tan ni la mi tawa ala mute. mi wile ala weka tan ni.
taso mi awen lon tenpo ale. mi kalama musi e ijo wawa ona.

  _ mi wile suli kepeken olin _

  ma li tawa sama e ijo ale anu seme? ale li wile suli li tawa sama e ale anu seme?
  nasin sama la sijelo mi li tawa ale ni: mi kama lon ijo, mi sona e ijo.
  
  
  
  
[I translated a poem by Walt Whitman
Beginning my studies
When my learning began, I liked the first steps very much.
Just facts.  These many forms.  Strong motion.
Lowly bugs and lowly animals.  Many feelings.  Sights. Love.
Oh, the first steps were powerful and pleased me greatly.
So I did not go on much. I did not want to go away from this.
But I stayed all the time.  I sang about their power.

I want to grow with love.
I want to grow with sexual love.
Doesn't  the earth move everything similarly?  Doesn't everything want to grow and move everything thus?
In the same way, my body move completely thus: I come to something.  I know the thing.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  BEGINNING my studies, the first step pleas'd me so much,
  The mere fact, consciousness--these forms--the power of motion,
  The least insect or animal--the senses--eyesight--love;
  The first step, I say, aw'd me and pleas'd me so much,
  I have hardly gone, and hardly wish'd to go, any farther,
  But stop and loiter all the time, to sing it in extatic songs. ]
