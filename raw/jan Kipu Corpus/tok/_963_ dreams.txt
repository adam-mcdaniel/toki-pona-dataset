[Marie Adele Elliott
Last night, when you were asleep, what did you see?  Write about your sleep here.
  
  Dominick DiMercurio II 
  Finally, much, I don't know my sleep country.. 
  
  Marie Adele Elliott 
  Too bad!  I also don't know.  But in knowing time, I want to talk about it to many people and want to know about the sleep of other people.  Ha ha! I like my sleep.
  
  Sergey Tihonov 
  When I sleep I see evil children harming sweet lizards.  I feel bad because of this dream.

Yonah Sienna 
Oh, bad!]
