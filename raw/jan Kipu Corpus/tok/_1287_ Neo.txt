[Stephan Schneider
Iknow that you are here.  I can feel you.  I know that you are afraid ... of us.  You fear change.  I don't know the future.  I don't want to talk to you about the end of this.  I want to talk to you about the beginning of this.  Now I am leaving this phone and giving a view to the people of this world.  It is a view of a world in the absence of your desires and in the absence of you and in the absence of laws and controls and in the absence of dividing country and limiting countries .  It is a view of a country where everything is possible.  For me you can direct a new travel.

Neo: I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid... you're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.   ]
