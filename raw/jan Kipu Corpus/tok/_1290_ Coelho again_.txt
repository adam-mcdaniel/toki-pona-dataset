[Joshua Birns-Sprague

A student says "For a long time, I wanted spiritual knowledge.  I feel that is close to me.  I want to know the way to get to it."
The spiritual master says "If a person know how to see the spiritual, that person knows how to preserve his body.  How do you preserve yourself?"
The student says "This is not important.  My parents are rich.  If I see the spiritual path, my parents preserve me.  So, I always see spiritual things."
The spiritual master says " Fine. I will tell you the way to get there.  Look at the full sun for a short time."
The student listened.  When he finished, the spiritual master wanted the student to say the name of the next country.  
The student say "I can't.  The full sun has ruined my sight a bit."
The spiritual master said "If a person looks at the full sun all the time, his sight is badly ruined.  If a person looks only at the sun and gives his physical actions to others, he sees nothing."]
