[Wall of thorns

The wife of the king gave birth to a daughter.  The king was very happy and wanted everybody in the country to come to the castle and celebrate.  He sent his messengers to tell the good news.  They went to everybody in the country except one witch. This witch was crazy and lived in a dark forest and fought the people who went to her.  At the party, everybody brought good thing for teh king and his wife and child.  Suddenly, the crazy witch came.  She said "You didn't say `Come' to me.  So I say `When this child is grown, a needle will puncture her hand.  From that, she will die." Suddenly the witch went away.  All the other witches changed this spell to "She will sleep perpetually".  But they could not block the spell.  Everyone was sad.  But everything continued.  The king banished all pointed instruments from the palace.

The girl grew up and was beautiful. One day the crazy witch became a woman with many balls and gave the girl an apple.  When she got it, a sharp twig pierced her hand.  Immediately, the girl fell asleep and stayed that way.  For a long time, there was a wall of thorns which surrounded the castle.  No one could get inside that wall.  No one could get over it. 

Once a prince was hunting in in the country for a long time.  and came to this wall.  He searched for a way to go inside or over.  But he did not find one.  He could not cut the plant.  When he tried to climb the the wall, the thorns punctured him.  But he could not stop searching.  Finally, he built a fire and set it to the plant.  The plant burned brightly.  The fire went to all the plant.  The plant became a heap of ashes.  The prince went to the palace and on inside.  He found a sleeping woman and also many sleeping people.  The woman was very beautiful.  So the prince kissed her.  Immediately, she woke up and kissed him back..  Everybody also woke up.  Everybody except the crazy witch celebrated.  The crazy with went away and stayed.  The woman and the prince were married and lived happily ever after.]
