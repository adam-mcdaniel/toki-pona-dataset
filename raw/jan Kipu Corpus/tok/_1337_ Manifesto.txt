[The rich can flee from the fierce war of working people.  Working people can give up nothing except ehir chaines.  Working people can get the wide world.
Workers of every nation, unite!


Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Working Men of All Countries, Unite! 
Marx and Engels, Manifesto]
