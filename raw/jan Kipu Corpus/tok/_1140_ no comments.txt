        Long texts are bad.

    Stop the strong language!
    We have good eyes and don't want to read long writings.
    I also used to send poems.  Nobody wanted to look for mistakes in them.  But I didn't speak badly to other people.

        My bad! If people don't talk to me a few times, I feel bad.]
