[Golden Hand
He rides down on the street
Of the town from the heights.
Nothing can block this:
Going to his woman.
Only this woman can heal
The dark spirit of the Hand.
The spirit of money is nothing to him.
Everything is one kiss.
For a gold hand is cold.
But a woman's hand is warm.
Yes, a gold hand is cold.
But a woman's hand is warm. 





[Verse]
He rode through the streets of the city
Down from his hill on high
O'er the wynds and the steps and the cobble
He rode to a woman's sigh
For she was his secret treasure
She was his shame and his bliss
And a chain and a keep are nothing
Compared to a woman's kiss

[Refrain]
For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are warm
For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are ...]
