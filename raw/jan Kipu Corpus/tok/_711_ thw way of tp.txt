[Joshua Birns-Sprague 
I think that If you want to use toki pona, you want to change your way of talking and your way of writing laws.  People don't like the way of toki pona.  The origin of toki pona is not wanting to know bad things.  You want to know good things only.  

Christa Hansberry 
This is true.  In a short time, I learned the words of toki pona.  But in a long time I learned the way of toki pona.  In the beginning, I thought that a person could not talk about many things in this language.  But now I can say many things and can understand many conversation of other people.]
