[Joshua Birns-Sprague
The way of statute is a thing of power and not a thing of good.

  
  Paco Zonzeani 
  There is another way and not many.  Do ypu agree?

Joshua Birns-Sprague 
In the world, there are many statutes, but the way of statutes is one.
Maybe there are two ways.  Lowly people are on one way.  Rich people are  on anothjer way..
