[Marcus Miles
Yesterday evening, we were together. The group consisted of me, my wife, and my parent. I wanted to go to the mountains in the car.  When I had travelled a little, I thought that I shouldn't go to the mountains.  I thought that, if I went, cold rain would fall from the sky.  Therefore, the road would be dangerous. I felt bad.  But I went home in the car.  In a little while, we three felt good in the light of Christianity in the home.
