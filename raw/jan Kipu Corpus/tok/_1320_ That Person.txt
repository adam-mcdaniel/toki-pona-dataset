[Sarah Brown
Today I thought about this song and made this.

My feelings are broken, oh1  I cannot speak.
My feelings are broken because That Person.
I travel in the cold dark 
To see That Person.
If that person comes again, he needs to travel a lot (he will travel on the ocean)
And something will come to everybody and i will see my Thant Person (Everybody will get their thing).
Oh for That Person!
Alas for that person!
If I want , I  cannot do
Everything for that person.  
Why do I fix my hair?
Why does the lamp burn in my bedroom?
My That Person is gone away.
For many days, I cry because
That person is gone far away.
Many days I cry because
That Person is gone far away.
I cannot sing.  I must not say
That my feelings are broken because of That Person. 

Do you like this?









Somebody
My heart is sore, I dare not tell, my heart is sore for Somebody
I would walk a winter's night all for a sight of Somebody
If Somebody were come again then one day he must cross the main
And everyone will get his own and I will see my Somebody
Chorus
Ochon, for Somebody, Och hey, for Somebody,
I would do, would I do not, All for the sake of Somebody
Why need I comb my tresses bright, oh, why should coal or candlelight
Shine in my bower day or night since gone is my dear Somebody
Oh, I have wept many a day for one that's banished far away
I cannot sing and must not say how sore I grieve for Somebody
Music: traditional Irish; lyrics: traditional Scottish 
Adapted by Connie Dover
From the CD, Somebody (Songs of Scotland, Ireland and Early America) by Connie Dover
An 18th Century Scottish code song about the exiled Bonnie Prince Charlie, and one of many songs which express yearning for a Stuart king on the throne of Scotland. I have set the lyrics to a variant of the Irish tune, "The Star of the County Down."]
Connie Dover - Lyrics for "Somebody" from the recording titled "Somebody"
