I am a Rock, by Simon and Garfunkel

In winter, I am alone.
On the downward path I see cold water in the hole.
I am a rock.
I am an island.

I make many walls for my strong home.
Nobody can damage it.
I don't want friends.
Friends make me sad.
I dislike songs and love.
I am a rock.
I am an island.

Don't say the word "love".
I heard that word in the past.
It sleeps in my head.
I did not finish the sleeptime of dead emotions.
If I don't love, I don't cry.
I m a rock.
I am an island.

My many pages and songs keep me.
I have a tough skin.
I stay in my home.
I feel nobody.
Nobody feels me. 
I am a rock.
I am an island.

A rock doesn't feel
An island doesn't cry.. 





  "I Am A Rock"
  
                                 A winter's day
                           In a deep and dark December
                                   I am alone
                              Gazing from my window
                              To the streets below
                   On a freshly fallen, silent shroud of snow
                                   I am a rock
                                 I am an island
                                        
                                I've built walls
                          A fortress, steep and mighty
                             That none may penetrate
                          I have no need of friendship
                             Friendship causes pain.
                    It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
                                   I am a rock
                                 I am an island
                                        
                               Don't talk of love
                        Well, I've heard the words before
                           It's sleeping in my memory
                         And I won't disturb the slumber
                           Of feelings that have died
                   If I never loved, I never would have cried
                                   I am a rock
                                 I am an island
                                        
                                 I have my books
                           And my poetry to protect me
                            I am shielded in my armor
                                Hiding in my room
                               Safe within my womb
                      I touch no one and no one touches me
                                   I am a rock
                                 I am an island
                                        
                            And a rock feels no pain
                           And an island never cries]
