  John Clifford Now that I am sure of the text, I can comment on a few minor points. 'soweli ike ona' is probably 'soweli ike ni' or just 'ona' alone, since you are referring back to an existing 'soweli ike' and using 'soweli ike ona' would be "their bad beasts". Conversely. 'tenpo ona' refers not to any particular word but to the previous situation (sentence as a whole) and so should be 'tenpo ni'. not sure what 'mi kama tawa weka' means above 'mi tawa weka' "I went away" maybe 'open tawa weka' "started to leave" or so? 'mute mute' is still not official in this sense, but is common colloquially, as here. It probably (but usage is still fluid) needs 'pi' and should be attached to 'tawa', not 'mi'. 'kasi ni' or just 'ona' fussiness: 'palisa lon noka' would be at the bottom of the tree, which helps the climbing, of course, but doesn't of itself get you out of reach. on the other hand, no branches can get you to the overhead of the tree, above it, only to lawa, the top. (both of these are pretty fuzzy in actual use). I love a classic.

  [A hunter is talking to his friend.
  "One night I wanted to hunt. 
  I went to the woods.
  After a long time I heard an awful howl.
  In a little while I saw many bad beasts.
  These  bad beasts eat other beasts.
  Now i knew that I didn't have my weapon.
  My weapon was at my home.
  I began to go away.
  But the beasts heard the noise of my feet.
  They wanted to eat me.
  I went very far away.
  The bad beast very much came toward me.
  I saw a big tree.
  This tree had many branches at its bottom.
  I went to the top of the tree using its many branches.
  I was at the top of the tree.
  In the dark and cold time, I fell asleep.
  When I feel asleep, I fell to the bottom of the tree."
  The hunter's friend asked when the hunter fell to the bottom of the tree, what did the bad beasts do?
  The hunter said "They ate me."]
