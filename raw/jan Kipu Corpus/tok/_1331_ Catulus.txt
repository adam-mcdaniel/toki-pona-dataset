[Bird, my woman loves you
And lovingly gives you a litle finger
To you to attack
With your beak.  This game is good 
For her and diminishes your pain.
Bird, I too want to play with you 
And want to diminish my pain. 


[Little bird, you are a pet of my beloved.
She plays with you and hold you in her front
And gives a finger to you to
Peck and even attack.
If my beloved woman want to play sweetly
And wants the pains of love to diminish, 
For me, she reduces these same pains.
May I too play similarly with you
And remove the ugliness from my spirit.



Sparrow, my sweet girl's delight,
whom she plays with, holds to her breast,
whom, greedy, she gives her little finger to,
often provoking you to a sharp bite,
whenever my shining desire wishes
to play with something she loves,
I suppose, while strong passion abates,
it might be a small relief from her pain:
might I toy with you as she does
and ease the cares of a sad mind!


Passer, deliciae meae puellae,
                                       1
Sparrow, my lady's pet, 
quicum ludere, quem in sinu tenere,
                                       2
with whom she often plays whilst she holds you in her lap, 
cui primum digitum dare appetenti
                                       3
or gives you her finger-tip to peck and 
et acris solet incitare morsus,
                                       4
provokes you to bite sharply, 
cum desiderio meo nitenti
                                       5
whenever she, the bright-shining lady of my love,
carum nescio quid lubet iocari
                                       6
has a mind for some sweet pretty play, 
et solaciolum sui doloris,
                                       7
in hope, as I think, that when the sharper smart of love abates, 
credo ut tum grauis acquiescat ardor:
                                       8
she may find some small relief from her pain--
tecum ludere sicut ipsa possem
                                       9
ah, might I but play with you as she does, 
et tristis animi leuare curas!
                                      10
and lighten the gloomy cares of my heart!
