A new book in Toki Pona has appeared. Its name is 'lipu tenpo'. The publishers of lipu tenpo want to create a new book every month. In Toki Pona, it's the number one book.

The editor of lipu tenpo says: 'If you want to write for this book, don't include things that are specific to one culture. You can write about things that happen at any time. But you can't express your feelings in your writing.'

Many people are unhappy about this. A black bird says: 'All writing is a cultural expression. If you write about culture, it will come out in your writing. If you try to suppress culture, culture will still be there; but it will only be good for bad people. This will only frustrate the desires of many people. So lipu tenpo should allow the expression of cultural ways.'

But the editor doesn't want to listen. He says: 'We're not discussing the content of the book here. I don't want to change the editorship of this book. Only the cultural editor can change.'

Jan Jan says: 'The editor of this book is doing bad things. He can't lead the group well. Change the editor. If the editor doesn't change, I'll leave my job.'

The editor asks the group: 'Do you want to change the editor?' Many people say yes. But he asks the question only to the employee: 'Do you want to change the editor?' The employee says no.

Therefore, the editor does not change. Jan Jan leaves the group and starts working on his own book.

Jan Jan creates a new group. Many people come to him. They create a new book. Its name is 'lipu kule'. It can have good content. Right now, the group is small, but it can grow and be good for everyone
