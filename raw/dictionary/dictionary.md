|pi|particle|(The particle pi is used to regroup modifiers. It requires a minimum of one head noun and two modifiers. pi is inserted between the head noun and the two modifiers. This indicates that the second modifier modifies the first modifier before the meaning is used to modify the head noun. It is particularly useful when the head noun and first modifier have a meaning unto themselves: ma tomo mi - [ma tomo][mi] -> my city. ma pi tomo mi - [ma]pi[tomo mi] -> the land (of/around/associated with) my house. When you see a noun group with pi, do not think of it as meaning "of". Think of it as a marker that indicates the end of the head noun, and the beginning of a modifier applied to the head. Figure out the meaning of each half first, and then combine these into a one.)|
