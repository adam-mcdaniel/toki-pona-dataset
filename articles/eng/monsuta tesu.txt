Well, if you're new to Toki Pona, this language might not be easy.

The word "monsuta" is a Toki Pona word from a long time ago. Its essence is this: if something is monstrous, it can cause harm to you or even kill you. That feeling of fear is called "pilin monsuta." The thing itself is "monsuta."

But what does the phrase "ona li monsuta e jan" mean?

For one person, that phrase means "he scares people." That person is afraid. But for another person, the phrase could mean "he turns people into monsters."

Some time ago, many people became interested in this strange thing. They named it a strange name: "monsutatesu." But where did this name "monsutatesu" come from? What does it mean? Does it have the same sense of strangeness?

The origin of this word is from a short time ago. But if you look for it in the old Toki Pona documents, you can see that some people used it before. They used "monsuta" as a verb, and its essence is this: if someone "monsuta-s" you, your spirit is hurt.

But in the language, it is not known. For a long time, no one has understood it. For a long time, it has been removed from many people's minds.

Then, one time, in the year 2020, Iko Pike wanted to know about it in the Toki Pona community. Nowadays, many people think that "ona li monsuta e jan" means "he causes a sense of fear or terror in people." But the interest in Iko Pike has increased. Many people talk about it.

For one person, "using English words in Toki Pona! The word "monsuta" is not the same as the English word "fear." English is strange!" But for another person, "the word "monsuta" can have many meanings! It's very interesting and good!"

The conversation continued. Many people talked. There were many opinions. Everyone was confused by this word "monsuta." What is "pilin monsuta?" Is it "the feeling of wanting to cause harm" or "the feeling of becoming evil?"

It became crazy. Everyone was talking. There were many ways of understanding. Everyone's heads were messed up by this word. Iko Pike disappeared, and this talk remained, breaking everyone's heads.

Well, this conversation is now over. But its end is not good. At the end, everyone feels, "Don't use the letter 'e' after 'monsuta.' But many people still do not understand how to use the word 'monsuta.'

Time passes. Maybe this crazy thing is over. Maybe it's gone...

But on this day, it returns! On this day, many people are chatting in the Toki Pona chat room. They talk about many things, including the strange way of "monsuta."

"Moo!" A sound comes from the #sona-musi room in the Toki Pona chat room. "Likipi talks about strange things in the chat!" Someone says. "He says the word 'mama' is the same as 'monsuta.'"

This makes many people confused.

"'I mother him' could mean 'I change him into a mother,' or 'I give good things to him, he is like a mother.'"

This makes many people even more confused.

"At this time, Likipi looked for all the words and wanted to know this: What word is as strange as 'monsuta'?"

Another person appears in the chat. "Oh, the word..."
