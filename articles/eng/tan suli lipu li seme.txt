Books come from the desires of many people. Books come from the work of many people. Many people are on many paths. But everyone wants this: may this book be good.

I can write many good things. But I write them using few words. Please learn the good ways of this book.

To me, what does 'good' mean?

- I want this book to be good for good people. Good people are not on one path. (Also, don't use bad ways.) If I want this book to be good, I want to hear from good people.
- I want this book to be from the knowledge of many people. If you want to share your ways, write in this book. If you want to learn from many people, use this book.
- I want this book to be from the knowledge of the Toki Pona community. The Toki Pona community is like everyone who speaks Toki Pona. People are everywhere! People talk a lot! People can be creative and diverse! The community is diverse.
- I want this book to provide knowledge of doing good. When people look at this book, I want them to be able to do good for everyone. People who give good things will increase using this book. Please be good for this.
- I want this book to allow people to have fun. Everyone wants to have fun. But fun is absent from many communities. This is very bad for us. With this book, fun can become new for everyone.

This is the good way of books. Write with this. Write with good. Write with fun. Then, everything can become good.

Go with the love of book creation.
